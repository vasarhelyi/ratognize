# ratognize
Ratognize is an OpenCV-based cpp tool for colored barcode tracking on video inputs, optimized for simple and fast execution on large scale footages.

It was developed at Eötvös University, Department of Biological Physics, throughout the EU ERC COLLMOT Research Grant (https://hal.elte.hu/flocking) for tracking painted animals for several hours, days or even months (don't worry, they were safe and treated well).

# install
The code relies on OpenCv 2.x, you should install that first (yes, I know, it is old, I will upgrade only if you really need it).

The code base was tested both under Linux (with gcc) and Windows (with Visual Studio) and should run smoothly.

However, the code was created for researchers by researchers, so sorry if it does not meet your coding standards... 

Any recommendations or help is welcome!
